Software Engineering OSS Project

This project is the creation of a iOS mobile application that will allow users to keep track of their emotions and provide suggestions, and they will aslo be able to see their stats for their overall average emotion and the average emotion for the current day, week and month.

This applicaiton is innovative because it provides a fun and easy way for people to keep track of their emotions and also obtain suggestions as to how they can improve their health and become a more happy person.  Along with this, it might be able to let the user see if they are having a reoccuring problem and if they chould see a professional to provide a more detailed solution.  For instance, someone might not realize that they are sick or stressed most of the time, but with the help of this app they would be able to see this.
